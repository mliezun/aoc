# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my Python solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 challenge, organized by days.

## Folder Structure

The solutions are organized by days, with each day's folder containing:

- `solve.py`: Python file with the solution code.
- `solve2.py`: Solution for the second problem.
- `input.txt`: Input file required for the solutions.

## Usage

To run any of the solutions, navigate to the specific day's folder and execute the Python file using Python 3.x:

```bash
python solve.py
```

Or:

```bash
python solve2.py
```

Input files (`input.txt`) necessary for the solutions are provided within the respective day's folder.
